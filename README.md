# DynamicDispatch

An exercise to help students better understand polymorphism in Java, by constructing a mechanism for dynamic method dispatch.

## Instructions

Use the files in this repository to set up a working version of this project on your own machine. You may clone this repo if you know how to do that. Otherwise, recreate the folder structure in a fresh project and copy-paste the source code into the appropriate files.

Follow the directions [here](doc/find-method-directions.md) to complete the `DynamicDispatch` class, then follow the directions [here](doc/create-demonstration-directions.md) to create a demonstration of dynamic dispatch.

After completing these steps, you will have a working dynamic dispatch mechanism that works by reflection, and a demonstration of its usage and behaviour.

Congrats!
